status: Just set up my own for-hire dev shop and calling it ... drum roll ... karsonkalt.dev. Just started working on As1 Social and leading a team of 4 engineers. It's somewhat of a new domain using React Native -- but all the patterns I know in react mostly apply. The mission for this project is really exciting, data self-sovereignty in social media. Can't wait to share more soon.

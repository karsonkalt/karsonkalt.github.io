status: Really proud of my latest work on the Data Explorer at JupiterOne. It's a pretty modular system with config-driven rendering. The explorer fetches relevant properties for the data set you are currently inspecting, provides rollup stats about each one, and has some different config types depending on the property data type. Already have applied it to a few entities in our db and the investment has really paid off!

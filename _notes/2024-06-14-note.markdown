I'm learning bash to help me feel more comfortable in my command line and customizing
my shell. It's been very helpful and informative so far and I'm feeling much
more comfortable in the cli.

### Things I don't love
- It's not strongly typed. Everything is treated as a string by default.
- Passing in variables will spread?
- Error handling is difficult with checking error statuses.
- Only boolean named parameters with flags. You can pass in parameters to a flag but it's pretty cumbersome.
- Spaces as argument delimiters is a big issue
- I don't understand differences between `grep` and `awk` very well. `awk` looks like a fleshed out scripting language, while `grep` is simple substring filter.

## Learnings
- What are the differences between `awk` and `grep`
- Square brackets are syntactic sugar for the test command
- Use `getopts` for getting flags
- Always quote your variable to avoid word splitting
- Name arguments inside function declarations with local variables
- Arithmetic is done inside parenthesis
